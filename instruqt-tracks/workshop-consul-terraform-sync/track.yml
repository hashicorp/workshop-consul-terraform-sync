  title: Review Lab Objectives
  teaser: Before we begin, lets quickly review the architecture.
  assignment: "In this workshop we will build the infrastructure depicted in the in
    the 'NIA - Traffic Flow' tab on the left, but before we do lets quickly review
    the operational challenges we are going to address.\n\n**Navigate to the 'NetOps
    - Operational Pattern' tab.**\n\nIn this diagram we have a two-tier application
    running on virtual machines that is being delivered by Consul Service Discovery.
    Not a complex use-case but a very common one. New virtual machins are frequently
    added and removed to handle scaling requirements and to 'A/B test' new functionality.
    These changes require frequent invovlement with the already overworked Net Operations
    team who must adjust/update security and load-balancing configurations.\nThe long
    hours and lengthy job queues results in deployment errors and, potnetially, security
    issues.\n\n**Navigate to the 'NIA - Operational Pattern' tab.**\n\nWith `Consul`
    providing real-time application state (IP Addresses and App meta-data), Consul
    Terraform Sync uses that infromation, and its visibility of all application state
    changes, to configure the network infrastructure eliminating the need for Network
    Operations teams invovlement in Day 2 Ops.\n\n**Navigate to the 'NIA - Traffic
    Flow' tab.**\n\nIn this diagram you can see the Traffic Flow of the infrastructure
    we are going to build in the following steps. \n\nNOTE: A fine-grained policy
    on the Palo Alto firewall is possible, without increasing operational overhead,
    when Consul Terraform Sync is automating the management of the policy address
    group.\n\nIn the next few challenges we are going to provision resources to build
    the cloud environment depicted in this diagram enabling you to see this workflow
    in operation."

  teaser: Provision a Palo Alto VM-Series Firewall using Terraform.
  assignment: |-
    Now we will configure the Palo Alto Firewall using Terraform.

     First, let's verify that the Palo Alto VM Series has been instanciated.
     In the `Shell` tab run the following commands.

     ```
    tail /root/terraform/panw-vm/terraform.out
    ```

     You should see `Apple complete!`. If not, take the time to review the Terraform IaC definition that will be used to configure the firewall in the 'Terraform Code' tab. If it has complete, proceed with the following commands to configure the firewall:

     ```
    terraform plan
    terraform apply -auto-approve
    ```

    Now we must instrut the firewall to `commit` this change using the following command:
    ```
    /root/terraform/panos_commit/panos-commit -config /root/terraform/panos_commit/panos-commit.json
    ```

    Once the apply is complete, you can Navigate to the Palo Alto Firewall
    using the information in the 'Access Info' tab. Open new browser tabs to access the Palo Alto and BIG-IP Virtual Machines.

    For CLI access to the Firewall execute:
    ```
    ssh -q -A -J azure-user@$bastion_ip paloalto@$firewall_ip
    ```

  title: Validate HCS
  teaser: Verify Vault, HCS, and Consul are operational
  assignment: |
    Consul HCS and Vault should now be provisioned and accessible from the corresponding tabs.

    In this exercise we will gather the information required to connect to HCS and securely store this information in Vault.

    In the `Shell` tab run the following commands.
    ```
    vault login -method=userpass username=operations password=Password1
    ```

    Retrieve the bootstrap token and gossip key from HCS and save it to your Vault instance.

    ```
    echo $CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR
    echo $VAULT_ADDR
    bootstrap_token=$(az hcs create-token --resource-group $(terraform output -state /root/terraform/vnet/terraform.tfstate resource_group_name) --name hcs | jq  -r .masterToken.secretId)
    gossip_key=$(az resource show --ids "/subscriptions/$(az account show | jq -r .id)/resourceGroups/$(terraform output -state /root/terraform/vnet/terraform.tfstate resource_group_name)/providers/Microsoft.Solutions/applications/hcs/customconsulClusters/hashicorp-consul-cluster" --api-version 2018-09-01-preview | jq -r .properties.consulConfigFile | base64 -d | jq -r .encrypt)
    vault kv put secret/consul master_token=${bootstrap_token} gossip_key=${gossip_key}
    ```

    Now inspect the credentials.

    ```
    echo $VAULT_ADDR
    vault kv get secret/consul
    ```
    You can use this token to login and explore the Consul UI, use of the master token should be highly restricted, instead let's configure Vault to issue [dynamic secrets](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/secrets/consul/) for Consul. <br>

    Get a management token for Vault to manage Consul tokens with.
    You can retrieve the privileged token for this operation from Vault.  <br>

    ```
    export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=$(vault kv get -field=master_token secret/consul)
    vault_consul_mgmt_token=$(consul acl token create -policy-name=global-management -description "vault mgmt" | grep SecretID | cut -d ":" -f2 | xargs)

    ```
    Now configure the secrets engine.

    ```
    vault write consul/config/access address=${CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR} token=${vault_consul_mgmt_token}
    vault read consul/config/access
    ```

    Last, create a policy for the operations team, and link it to the Vault role.

    ```
    consul acl policy create -name "ops" -description "admin policy for ops" -rules 'acl = "write" operator = "write" namespace_prefix "" {acl = "write"}'
    vault write consul/roles/ops policies=ops ttl=1h
    ```

    Now you are ready to get a dynamic Consul token from Vault for an operator.
    Validate the token after you fetch it. <br>

    ```
    export CONSUL_HTTP_TOKEN=$(vault read -field token consul/creds/ops)
    consul acl token read -self
    ```

    You can use this token to set up the anonymous policy.

    ```
    echo '
    node_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
    service_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
    session_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
    agent_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
    query_prefix "" {
      policy = "read"
    }
    operator = "read"' |  consul acl policy create -name anonymous -rules -
    consul acl token update -id anonymous -policy-name anonymous
    ```

    You will use this role in a later assignment to configure access for Consul service consumers.

  title: Review app environment
  teaser: Review the components of the app application
  assignment: |-
    The VM based application is now configured as part of a VM scale set on Azure.  One of the first challenges that comes up is that instances of the scale set will be provisioned with dynamic IP addresses. <br>

    This makes it difficult to maintain any configuration files which require hard coded IP addresses, luckily Consul can help solve this.

    Consul maintains a real-time catalog of all of the nodes and services in the environment.  This catalog can be queried using a UI, CLI, API, or simple DNS interface.

    Let's review the components of the application and see how Consul is leveraged in different ways.

    ** F5 LTM ** <br>

    **Remember you will to need to view this UI in a different browser tab**, for convenenience we have put all the required information in the `info.txt` file in the `App Access Info` tab <br>

    The VIP and pools are provisioned in the `consul-terraform-sync` partition, make sure you select it from the drop down menu in the top right corner of the screen.

    You can view the VIP in the BIG-IP UI by naviagating to the `Local Traffic -> Virtual Servers`

    You can view the pool members navigating to `Local Traffic -> Pools`


    ** Web Tier ** <br>

    Company policy is to have ingress communications pass though an F5 Load-balancer running an ASM Web Application Firewall policy.

    The VIP for the web tier of the application lives on the F5 BIG-IP virtual appliance. The pools servicing this VIP are dynamically populated by querying Consul for all instances of the service called `web` <br>

    The mapping between Consul and the pools was declared in the AS3 declaration of the VIP.

    Next you can explore some of the service discovery capabilities of Consul.

    View the nodes and services via CLI

    ```
    consul members
    consul catalog services
    ```

    You can also retrieve information programatically via the API.  In this example you will be determining the IP address of the first web servers returned by the API. <br>

    ```
    web_server=$(curl -s $CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR/v1/catalog/service/web | jq -r '.[0].Address')
    echo $web_server
    ```

    ** NGiNX **

    Nginx is running on each of the web servers and is used to proxy and load balance requests to the app tier.

    Rather than managing the configuration files for the proxy manually, we'll instead rely on Consul and a library called [Consul Template](https://github.com/hashicorp/consul-template) <br>

    Consul Template is responsible for monitoring Consul for changes to the `app` service, and when changes are detected, render a new configuration file and restart NGiNX automatically.

    **Pro Tip:** Consul template can render any ASCII based configuration files you may need for other purposes, and fire a user defined handler after (re)rendering. <br>

    The next few steps will show how this is configured, by accessing the `$web_server` you discovered and stored previously through a bastion host that has also been configured. <br><br>

    1. Review the consul-template configuration
    ```
    ssh -q -A -J azure-user@$bastion_ip azure-user@$web_server \
      sudo cat /etc/consul-template/consul-template-config.hcl
    ```
    <br>

    2. Review the templated nginx configuration

    ```
    ssh -q -A -J azure-user@$bastion_ip azure-user@$web_server sudo cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/load-balancer.conf.ctmpl
    ```
    <br>
    3. Review the rendered configuration, and compare it to the information you've discovered via the other Consul interfaces.

    ```
    ssh -q -A -J azure-user@$bastion_ip azure-user@$web_server sudo cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ```

    We are now able to connect things together using **Service Names** instead of IP addresses. In the next exercise we will scale the application and watch Consul take care of the rest! <br>

  title: Scale the application
  teaser: Let Consul take care of routine adds/moves/changes of services instances.
  assignment: |-
    Now let's re-run the Terraform code for the app application, but pass in some new variables for the scale parameters.

    ```
    terraform apply -var app_count=3 -var web_count=3 -auto-approve
    ```

    After the Terraform run completes, you can monitor the status of your nodes and services using the Consul UI. Once all of the new instances are online and healthy, you can revisit some of the things we reviewed in the previous exercise.

    View the nodes and services via CLI

    ```
    consul members
    consul catalog services
    ```

    Review all of the web instances
    ```
    curl -s $CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR/v1/catalog/service/web | jq
    ```

    Review all of the app instances
    ```
    curl -s $CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR/v1/catalog/service/app | jq
    ```

    Review the updated nginx configuration on the web_server
    ```
    ssh -q -A -J azure-user@$bastion_ip azure-user@$web_server sudo cat /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf
    ```

    Review the VIP and pool configuration on LTM once again.

    The resources for this lab will self-destruct in 8 hours, but to save a little money, **please scale the application back down.**

    Re-run Terraform, and monitor the various integration points once again. We'll do so in the background so that you can move on whenever you're ready. <br>

    ```
    nohup terraform apply -var app_count=1 -var web_count=1 -auto-approve > /root/terraform/app/scaledown.out &
    ```

    **Some other things you can try:**

    1. Refresh the application page several times, and notice the load balancing occur.
    2. Explore the [Consul API](https://www.consul.io/api-docs/index) a bit more, Consul is a wonderful real-time source of truth for dynamic network environments.
    ```
    curl -s $CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR/v1/health/checks/web | jq
    curl -s $CONSUL_HTTP_ADDR/v1/health/checks/app | jq
    ```
    3. Consul can even estimate [round trip](https://www.consul.io/docs/internals/coordinates) times between nodes/datacenter. This is useful for finding the closest service instance, or datacenter for failover operations.
    ```
    consul rtt web-vm-000001 app-vm-000000
    ```
    **NOTE:** you may need to update the node names to match your environment

    Now that we are routing traffic based upon **service identity** we gain a lot of flexibility as more modern microservices architectures are adopted.

      75% companies surveyed take Days or even Weeks to complete networking tasks.

      Organizations seeking to improve application delivery cycle are often blocked at the networking layer
